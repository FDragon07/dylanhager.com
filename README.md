This website was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main creation of it started November 29th, 2024. I did use github copilot to help but over the past year I have found it to be more code review then coding so I have stopped relying on it. For the hosting of the website I used GitHub Pages and attached the custom domain I got from DreamHost. Everything can be found on my GitHub page.
